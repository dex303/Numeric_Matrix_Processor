Stage 6/6: Inverse matrix
Description
In this stage, you should find an inverse of a matrix. You need to use the information you’ve got in the previous stages. The inverse matrix \( A^{−1} \) is the matrix, the product of which, and the original matrix \(A\) is equal to the identity matrix. You can watch the following video to better understand inverse matrices .
\( A \times A^{-1} = A^{-1} \times A = I \)
The identity matrix is the matrix in which all elements of the main diagonal are 1 and all other elements are 0. Example of a \(4, 4\) identity matrix:
\(I_{4,4} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &0\\ 0 & 1 & 0 &0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1&0 \\0 & 0 & 0 &1\end{pmatrix}\)
The inverse of a matrix can be found using this formula:  \( A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{det(A)} \times C^T \)
As you can see, it contains a lot of operations you've implemented during the previous stages, such as finding cofactors of all the elements of the matrix, transposition of the matrix, finding the determinant of a matrix, multiplication of a matrix by a constant.
\( det(A) \) is a determinant of a matrix \( A \) and \( C^T \) is the matrix that consists of cofactors of all the elements of the matrix \( A \) transposed relative to the main diagonal. The inverse matrix can’t be found if \( det(A) \) equals zero. You can look at the calculation example in this  video.
Also, you can implement a method that can print a matrix in a readable way; every column would be correctly aligned. You can round the results by two or more digits.
Example
Below is an example of what your output might look like:
1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix to a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: > 6
Enter matrix size: > 3 3
Enter matrix:
> 2 -1 0
> 0 1 2
> 1 1 0
The result is:
 0.33   0  0.33
-0.33   0  0.66
 0.16 0.5 -0.33

1. Add matrices
2. Multiply matrix to a constant
3. Multiply matrices
4. Transpose matrix
5. Calculate a determinant
6. Inverse matrix
0. Exit
Your choice: > 0
